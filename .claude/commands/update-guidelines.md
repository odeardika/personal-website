# Update Project Guidelines

You are tasked with updating the existing GUIDELINES.md and/or .clauderules files.

## What to Update

Section to focus on: `$ARGUMENTS` (if empty, analyze what needs updating)

## Step 1: Review Current State

1. Read the existing `GUIDELINES.md` and `.clauderules` files
2. Analyze recent changes to the project:
   - New dependencies added
   - New folders/files created
   - Changes to configuration
   - Recent git commits for context

## Step 2: Identify Updates Needed

Compare current documentation with actual project state:
- Are there new frameworks/libraries not documented?
- Have ports or commands changed?
- Are there new patterns being used?
- Is there outdated information?

## Step 3: Update Files

Make targeted updates to keep documentation accurate:
- Add new sections if needed
- Update existing sections with accurate information
- Remove outdated information
- Update the "Last Updated" date

## Guidelines

1. **Preserve existing structure** - Don't reorganize unless necessary
2. **Be surgical** - Only update what's changed
3. **Keep consistency** - Match the existing writing style
4. **Update dates** - Always update the "Last Updated" field

## Output

After updating, summarize:
- What sections were updated
- What new information was added
- What outdated information was removed
